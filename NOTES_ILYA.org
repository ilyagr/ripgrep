* Why not the one-line version (hard part)
** Makes =-T= override =-g=.
** Type vs hidden different from type vs ignore (change, very good)
Weird because glob is supposed to be stronger that type, but cannot override hidden

* Why I like hidden/ignored interaction
- Both enabled by default
- My example of .ignore
- Perhaps mention/comment in [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1680]]?

* =-g *= same as no glob (unless at end)
